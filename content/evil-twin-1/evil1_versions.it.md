# Versions comparison

Dreamcast was the first target for Evil Twin's production. But In Utero used their middleware Phoenix3D to work simultaneously for the Playstation 2 & Windows PC version.

However, there are a few differences between them.

## Dreamcast

On Dreamcast, the game suffer from two missing levels and a higher texture compression. During ingame cinematics, [voices acting cuts the soundtrack](https://twitter.com/ocornut/status/1171361852313370625). Due to memory issue there is also less NPC. However lighting effects are quite good. Better than de PS2 version.

Whereas the game used to cost nothing in 2002/2003, it's now an expensive dreamcast game.

## Playstation 2 & Windows

Windows & PS2 versions are almost the same. Even if the texture compression is less destructive on PC. The main difference are the lighting effects. There is almost nothing on PS2.
