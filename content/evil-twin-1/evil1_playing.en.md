# Playing Evil Twin nowadays

You can play Evil Twin through emulation or the original Windows version. The most comfortable way to play the game is the PCSX 2 one. You'll get widescreen, saves-states and modern controller support out of the box.

## Emulation

On Mac, Linux or Android, the easiest way is the Dreamcast or Playstation 2 version. For the Dreamcast, [Redream](https://redream.io/) support the game from start to end. Despite being the [inferior version of the game](evil1_versions), if you're running on a low-end computer, it's a good option.

On PCSX2 you'll get the best experience. The game is really close to the Windows version, plus [widescreen](evil1_widescreen), plus saves states, plus modern controller support. And now there is a good edition for [mac](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/releases).

## The Windows version

You can still play on Windows 10. It's not that tricky. Install the game, the [update 1 and the no-cd](/Files/) (because Windows doesn't support theses DRM anymore...). Set all .exe from the game folder on "Windows XP compatibility mode".

If you want to play on a higher resolution than 1024x768, you'll need dgVoodoo 2.

Modern controllers needs [Xidi](https://github.com/samuelgr/Xidi).
