# Evil Twin: Kroniki Cypriena

Polish guys from [Sega Sky](http://www.sega.c0.pl/faqs/eviltwin_cyprien_spolszczenie_dreamcast.html) translated many Japanese games to English (The Lost Golem, LOL...).

For Evil Twin, they did a great job translating everything in polish. I mean, user interface, text **and** audio. The patch is available since 12/23/2018 at [Segasky](https://segasky.itch.io/evil-twin-kroniki-cypriena-spolszczenie). It requires an original .gdi dump.
